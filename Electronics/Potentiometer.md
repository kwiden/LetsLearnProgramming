## Potentiometers

One of the simpliest feedback devices - aside from a button- is the potentiometer, also know as a "pot". Pots can be used in things like light dimming knobs, volume dials. or to detect how much something has spun. 

Pots, unlike other rotational sensors, have a limited throw - older volume dials only turn so far before they hit a hard stop. As eletronics technology improves, complex potentiometers are being made with larger and even infinite throws.

For those with no electrical circuit training, an easy way to think about a pot is thinkng about a river dam. When the dial is all the way in one direction, the dam lets a lot of water flow. When the dial is at the other limit, very little water flows. Using an _Analog Input_ on our robot, we can measure how much "water" is flowing through the dam to determine what position the dial is.

The applications are unlimitd, but common uses include things like "knowing the angle of an arm," "setting the speed of a motor (ie as a input at the driver station)", or other situations where there is a defined minimum and maximum value that the system **cannot** exceed. If a pot is forced to rotate beyond its hard-stops, you will break the sensor.
