### Why Lets Learn Programming?

After a season with 1296, I was unhappy with our training system for new programmers and started creating the Lets Learn Programming (LLP) series. Having been a TA for Iowa State's "Intro to C" courses for nearly 4 years, I have a good grasp on how to teach newbies how to program. I used my experience as a TA and the structure of the hands-on labs to develop LLP.

Currently LLP is written with 1296's 2017 robot in mind. As LLP grows and evolves, it will become a broader tool for instruction that can be used by others not affiliated with 1296.


### Who is Katie?

I'm a computer engineer working who likes writing firmware. I've worked at places like [Iris Automation](https://www.irisonboard.com/) and [VEX Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com/). Currently I work at [Orro](https://www.getorro.com/).

I do a lot of robot stuff. I was a student on FRC 1675 in Milwaukee, WI. After graduating high school, I went to Iowa State University and with two other students started FRC 3928. I mentored 3928 for three years before taking a break to focus on graduating and instead volunteered as an FTA for FTC events. After graduation I moved to Texas and mentored FRC 1296 for two years. I also volunteered at local VEX events and have both worked and volunteered at VEX Worlds. In 2018, I moved to California and met local team, FRC 253.

One time Spectrum asked me questions about FRC and my job (2016), which you can find [here](http://blog.spectrum3847.org/2016/10/katie-widen-this-is-how-i-work.html) - its pretty outdated at this point but that's life. I frequent Chief Delphi under the username [Katie_UPS](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/member.php?u=25036).

Besides the engineering stuff, I have a [very cute dog](https://www.instagram.com/gatsbypaws/) who accompanies me on backpacking and camping trips. I also enjoy creative pursuits such as painting and playing various musical instruments.

### Who else is helping?

Jeffrey Tessitore: Jeffrey is an FRC 1296 alumni who is now attending Texas Tech. Jeffrey helped with writing some of the C++ tutorials.

Additionally, [LLP has been modified to teach Java](https://github.com/Filip3314/LetsLearnProgramming) by Filip3314. Thanks Filip!

### I have a suggestion for an improvement/correction

I'm always looking for ways to improve my teaching resources. If you found something incorrect, typo'd, or needs improving you can either [submit an issue](https://github.com/kwiden/LetsLearnProgramming/issues) on github or email me at knwiden at gmail dot com.
