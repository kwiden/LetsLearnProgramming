# Basics

### Thinking     
* Break down problem
* Code executes sequentially
* vars hold their value
* (little sister problem)

### Variables        
* ints
* doubles
* chars
* bools   
* #define
* formatting

### Functions        
* library functions (printf)
* user defined

### Logic        
* if/else   
* and `&&` or `||`  not `!`
* Comparisons
    * Greater Than `>` Less Than '<'
    * Equal to `==` Not Equal to `!=`
    * Greater Than or Equal to `>=`, Less Than or Equal to `<=`

### Loops
* while loop  
* for loop

### Objects      
* basic idea of an object
* Objects we'll use in robots
* -motor controllers (set speed, get encoder, etc)
* -joystick/controller (get button, get joystick, etc)

# Robot!    

### Driving  
* read Joystick
* drive motors

### Basic Subsystem  
* read button
* drive motor

### Intermediate Subsystem
* read buttons
* run motors
* use limit switches

### Advanced Subsystem
* Buttons map to positions
* use CANTalon encoder
* find appropriate positional offsets
* tune PID loops

### Advanced Subsystem Cont.
* combine/modify commands
* keep track of current states
* conditionals

### Combining Steps
* Combine/modify commands
* keep track of arm states
* utilize timing
* control multiple subsystems with one command

### Basic Auto
* use encoders to drive specific distances
* timing
* combining instructions

### Advanced Auto
* read gyro/use to control turn angle
* timing
* combining instructions
